# todo-list-api
This todo list api is made in Express(Node Js)

I developped it to train myself to use express and by the way help myself to build some front end with new languages that i want to learn

But you can 

Developp your front end skills by using my todo-list api for your backend

So, how does it work : 

Model :  
  -Task
  -List (that contains task)
  
Routes : 
  ....
